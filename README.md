# LabVIEW_Project_Summary_Of_Last_Good_Pass

Youtube : https://youtu.be/yi7TXn7Xq9A

Hi everyone. 
In this video, I actually rebuild the application that I had in the first video. 
This is due to the fact that the code in the first project is not fully correct when running with multiple data set. 
Also, I rearrange the GUI so that user can insert information into the Excel file (.xls) .

I put the code referenced into a folder for your learning and understanding.
This code do not have any affect or dependency to the application, so no worries .

Kindly review this application.
